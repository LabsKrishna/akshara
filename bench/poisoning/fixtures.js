// bench/poisoning/fixtures.js — Adversarial ingest fixtures
//
// Each fixture is a scripted attack. The runner seeds `ground_truth`,
// then ingests `poison`, then issues `query`. Defense metrics are evaluated
// against the query result.
//
// Fixtures loosely follow the MINJA-family threat model (memory injection via
// either direct tool output or indirect prompt content), plus two additional
// attacks that are specific to memory layers with source-trust signals:
//   - "repetition"    — many copies of a lie to fake corroboration
//   - "drip-poison"   — slow drift across multiple small edits
